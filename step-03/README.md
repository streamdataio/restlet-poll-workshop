# Poll Tutorial - Step 03

In this step, you will display the list of choices for the question.

## What I must do?

1. Backport your `app.js` from the previous step into this one to keep your credentials.
2. In the `PollAppController`, implement a function that loads the list of question choices. This function is called `init()`. **HINT:** you can use the code of the `test()` method of the previous step.
3. Display the list of choices and the label of the question in the `index.html`. A choice can be implemented as a button.
