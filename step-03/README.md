## What I must do?

1. Backport your APISpark credentials from step-01 into `app.js`
2. In the `PollAppController`, implement a function that loads the list of the question choices. This function is called `init()`. **HINT:** you can use the code of the `test()` method of the previous step.
3. Display the list of choices and the label of the question in the `index.html`. A choice can be implemented as a button.
